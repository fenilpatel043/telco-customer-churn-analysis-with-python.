# telco-customer-churn-analysis.
Customer churn analysis using Python, Pandas, and visualization techniques to identify key factors influencing customer retention.

Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 7,043 customers to understand why customers leave and how businesses can improve retention.

Using Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, I identified clear churn patterns and provided data-driven recommendations for reducing customer loss.

Key Findings

Overall Churn Rate: 26.5% → Around 1 in 4 customers leave.
Senior Citizens: Churn rate at 41.7%, nearly double compared to non-seniors (23.6%).
Contract Type:
Month-to-Month: 42.7% churn (very high risk)
One-Year: 11.2% churn
Two-Year: 2.8% churn (best retention)
Internet Service:
Fiber Optic → 41.9% churn 
DSL → 18.9% churn
No Internet → 7.4% churn
Dependents & Partners:
Customers without dependents → 31% churn
Customers with dependents → 15% churn
Customers without partners → 33% churn
Customers with partners → 20% churn
Gender: Minimal difference (Male 26.1% vs Female 26.9%).

Visual Insights

 Bar charts → Churn distribution by contract type and internet service
 Pie chart → Loyal vs Churned customers
 Histograms → Churn distribution by age group & senior citizens
 These visualizations highlight the risk groups and support the statistical findings.

 Recommendations

Support Senior Citizens → Simplify billing & provide personalized support.
Promote Long-Term Contracts → Incentives like discounts or upgrades to shift customers away from month-to-month plans.
Investigate Fiber Optic Service → High churn suggests service quality or support issues that must be fixed.
Target Single Customers → Loyalty campaigns & offers to increase engagement.

Tech Stack

Python → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook → cust_churn.ipynb
Report → PDF summary with findings & recommendations

Results

Identified high-risk customer segments (senior citizens, fiber users, month-to-month contracts).
Confirmed that long-term contracts drastically reduce churn.
Delivered actionable business recommendations backed by data.
