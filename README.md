Customer churn analysis using Python, Pandas, and visualization techniques to identify key factors influencing customer retention.

Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 7,043 customers to understand why customers leave and how businesses can improve retention.

Using Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, I identified clear churn patterns and provided data-driven recommendations for reducing customer loss.
